# About Me
I am currently a student pursuing a Bachelors in computer science at the University of North Texas. I intend to graduate in the December of 2025. I am an eager learner and always like to branch out and learn new things that catch my interest in technology. I've been learning how to write code over these last few years and have gained experience in a variety of languages. My passion for coding and building projects started when I would see so many applications being built during the pandemic and so I decided to go and look into computer science. After learning how to code and finishing a small personal project, I felt like this was what I love and what I wanted to do for my career. I am a person that likes to ask questions and work in a team environment, in my current position I have been not only working in a team environment but overseeing team environments as well.
